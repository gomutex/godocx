// Package docx provides a comprehensive set of functions and structures
// for manipulating DOCX documents. It allows for the creation, modification,
// and retrieval of document elements such as paragraphs, styles, and images.
// The package is designed to be accessed through the RootDoc element or
// instances of inner elements, providing a flexible and intuitive API for
// working with Office Open XML (OOXML) documents.
//
// // The RootDoc structure is initialized from the main godocx package,
// which provides methods for creating a new document from a default template or
// opening an existing document.
